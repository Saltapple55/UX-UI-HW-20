        <h2> Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Chess’n Math Association is a non-profit organization dedicated to teaching children chess. They run extracurriculars in various schools and cities at an affordable price, fostering the development of the brain. 
        </p>
        <p>However, Chess’n Math had some difficulty getting new customers with their website, especially with competitors arising. We set to re-design the website to make it more appealing to customers</p>
        <h2> Our Responsibilities</h2>
        <p> We first did research on current and potential customers to  find out their issues with the website. Taking those issues, we created a user persona to base the redesign for. All of then contributed to creating and iterating a wireframe, taking redesign elements from answers to create our current prototype. </p>
        <p>In particular, I was the representative from Chess’n Math Association, and was thus able to speak for the company’s needs to my team. My position allowed me to reach out to current customers more easily. My insight also informed a lot of redesign decisions for the initial wireframes, what was needed and what was redundant. </p>

      <h3>USER INSIGHT</h3>
      <p>
        Users get deterred from using Chess’n Math due to the confusing navigation and the many steps it takes to book a class online.</p>
      <h3>PROBLEM SOLUTION</h3>
      <p>
        We believe, that by redesigning the Chess’n Math website with a focus on creating an organized and seamless navigation with emphasis on a simple design, will reduce the time it takes for a user to engage with the website by half and increase the number of registrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will know our redesign is successful if we manage to address the design and navigation challenges and thus increase the number of registrations and website traffic

      <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
      <p>Based on initial feedback from interviews, we focused on simplifying the registration process by allowing customers to filter classes based on time and skill preferences.</p>
      <p>In addition, the number of pages for checkout have been reduced, with the option to bypass the process through login.</p>
